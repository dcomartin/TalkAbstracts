# Stop Looking in the Past. Tell the Future!

Ever write a batch job? Code that looks periodically at your database's current or historic state and then acts on it. They often run off hours or in the middle of the night to avoid performance impacts, and if they fail while processing, get ready for a page! 

You can prevent this nightmare by telling your system what to do in the future! Join Derek as he explores how to move away from batch jobs by looking at the real world to model a long-running business process from start to finish using messaging.
