# Building self documenting HTTP APIs with CQRS

## Abstract

Does your HTTP API expose your database structure?

HTTP endpoints that represent your database entities couples your consuming clients to the internals
of your application.  Making it much harder to change your API.

Go beyond serializing a database row into json by leveraging CQRS.

Start designing an HTTP API like a regular HTML website.  Bringing the concepts of HTML links and forms
to your API allows your clients to consume it with ease.

Attendees will learn how to design an HTTP API by leveraging CQRS and hypermedia to decouple their core application
from their HTTP API.
