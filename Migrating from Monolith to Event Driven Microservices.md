# Migrating from Monolith to Event Driven Microservices

## Abstract

Are you working in a monolithic codebase and thinking about moving to a microservices architecture? Do you have a large relational database with hundreds of tables? The task of migrating to microservices can seem impossible and a big bang rewrite can be a recipe for disaster.

In this presentation we're going to learn how to incrementally refactor a monolithic application to microservice.  To start we explore an existing codebase and discover service boundaries. From there, we'll use different patterns such as CQRS, Events, Pub+Sub to split our application into autonomous services.
