# Modular Monolith: Microservices the good parts

## Abstract

Is your application developed using a monolithic architecture? Has it turned into a big ball of mud that's 
difficult to change because of all the tight coupling?  

Microservices might seem like the answer with a lot attractive benefits. But before you jump to 
microservices to solve your coupling nightmares, maybe you should consider the modular monolith!

Join Derek as he tackles how to create a modular monolith that has explicit boundaries, well defined 
interfaces, and modules that are loosely coupled.  Get some of the benefits of a microservices 
architecture without the complexity.
