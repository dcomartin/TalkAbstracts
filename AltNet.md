# This isn't your Dad's .NET Stack

## Abstract

What's a technlogy stack? Often times refered to as pre-defined list of technologies.

ASP.NET MVC/WebAPI, Entity Framework and SQL Server stack sound familiar?  Sounds like a hammer to me.

Attendees will learn about frameworks and libraries that are alternatives to using what Microsoft ships
out of the box in their default Visual Studio Project templates.

This will help the audience better understand the choices being made for them and different choices they
can make that may be a better fit for the problem.
