# Vertical Feature Slices, not Layers!

## Abstract

<<<<<<< HEAD
Need to add a feature and end up changing many files through multiple projects?  Painful isn't it?

Developing your application by technical concern can also lead to bleeding logical concerns between layers.

Attendees will learn the agility of developing and organize their code by features instead of technical layers.
=======
Does adding a new feature require you to modify files across multiple projects in your UI, 
business and data access layers? Tired of mapping DTOs through the various layers of your 
system?  A layered architecture can be a painful when you really develop in verticle slices.

In this presentation we're going to learn how to develop and organize code by features 
instead of technical layers.  To start, we will cover the benefits and how to create 
a verticle slice using SOLID principles.  From there, we'll rewrite and reorganize 
parts of an existing application.
