# Vertical Feature Slices, not Layers!

## Abstract

Does adding a new feature require you to modify files across multiple projects in your UI business and data access layers? Tired of mapping DTOs through the various layers of your system?A layered architecture can be a painful when you really develop in verticle slices.

In this presentation we're going to learn how to develop and organize code by features instead of technical layers.  To start, we will cover the benefits and how to create a verticle slice using SOLID principles.  From there, we'll rewrite and reorganize parts of an existing application.
