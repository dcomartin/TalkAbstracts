# Vertical Slice Architecture, not Layers!

## Abstract

Nobody wants to deal with a system that is hard to change and easy to introduce bugs because it's a spaghetti code mess of various technical concerns.  

Clean Architecture is popular because it forces a separation of concerns into many different layers. But why are we organizing code by layers? 
Does adding a new feature require you to modify files across multiple projects in your UI, business, and data access layers?

Join Derek as he explains Vertical Slice Architecture and how to organize code and to focus on features instead of technical layers will make your system easier to change.
