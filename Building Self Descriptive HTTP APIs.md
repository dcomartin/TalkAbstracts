# Building Self Descriptive HTTP APIs

## Abstract

Does your HTTP API expose your database structure and provide GET/POST/PUT/DELETE as way to expose CRUD operations?

HTTP endpoints that represent your database entities couples your consuming clients to the internals
of your application.  Making it much harder to change your API.

Go beyond serializing a database row into json.

Attendees will learn how to design an HTTP API by leveraging hypermedia to decouple their core application
from their HTTP API.
