# Automating Builds with C#

## Abstract

Building from Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI can often have very different results than your CI Server.  

Build servers often hide other steps such as storing artifacts, executing tests and packaging.  This makes it almost impossible to
run the same tasks locally.

Attendees will learn how to create build scripts using Cake (C# Make) to execute and build, test and deploy from anywhere.
